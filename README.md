KUDOS
-----

This flask app will (eventually) allow you to support a site where you and your 
team can track internal/external kudos for review cycles or newsletters.

To build/run the skeleton as is, clone the project and then run in the project root:

* docker build -t unit113-py37 .
* docker run -d -p 8000:8000 unit113-py37
